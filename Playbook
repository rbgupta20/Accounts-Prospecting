1. Linkedin for Prospecting
  a. Company Tab: Search for a keyword ex: "Cable Tray Manufacturer"  (use double quote for near exact search)
  b. Put other required filters: Location, Employee account etc
  c. Output: Companies with 10 results per page
  
d1. Manually copy paste these details into Chatgpt and get structured output
      - Company Name, Industry, Location, Followers, Summary/Key Products, Category

d2 Run a code in Console of the page to get structure output in csv format (refer code "Extracting structured data from Liknedin Page using Console"
e. Use BrightData to get details from Linkedin Company Profile Link.(go to Data -> Scrapers Library)
(1.5 USD for 1000 Linkedin links)
  
  e. Check Relevancy using LLM API from field: "Summary/Key Products"
  f. Use Company Name to get GSTINs from Google using Serp API or Pyautogui
  g. From GSTIN: get GSTIN enrichment thorugh Jamku (Pyautogui/Selenium)

                  f & g detailed working for accuracy:-
                  (*for all company name, ensure "pvt", "pvt." , ltd" & "ltd." are converted to "private" & "Limited"
                   
                  Let's first solve for accounts prospected through LinkedIn only:-
                   
                  for a given company, we have company location
                     - Find GSTINs using Seper API.  Get all GSTINs against a company with Company name  & GSTIN in 2 columns. 
                    - Select company name's GSTINs with exact match only
                    - now remove the duplicates
                    - Count the unique PANs against a company name
                              - Count GSTINs against each of the above PANs
                    - For above GSTINs pull data from Jamku
                   - For pulled data, 
                              - filter out company names with no exact match
                              - Inactive GSTINS
                     - Even after above more than 1 PANs is there against a company name, mention those PANs in the column, and Turnover etc.  (multiple entries.)  As Sales team works on those leads, they need to mark the right PAN when they come to know about it.         
                  )
Excel formula:-
=IF(
  ISNUMBER(
    SEARCH(
      SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(LOWER(A2)," ",""),".",""),
      SUBSTITUTE(SUBSTITUTE(LOWER(B2)," ",""),".","")
    )
  ),
"YES","NO")


2. For a given Company Name: how to check Relevancy
  a. Using "Company Name + Linkedin" searched on Google through Pyautogui, extarcted Linkedin Link of the company
  b. Through Selenium, forem the above link, extarcted data
    - Overview, Website, Industry, Company size, Headquarters, Specialities
  c. Through Overview & Specialities: check for Relevancy using LLM API

*Above can also be used to find HQ & Industry for a given company name
Limitation: Works for companies having Linkedin Page


3. Google for Propsecting
  a. For Search terms such as "Cable Tray manufacturers in Maharashtra":, used SearchAPI for getting top 30 search results
      - POsition, Title, Link, Snippet
